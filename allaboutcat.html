            <h2 style="color: #352D23;">How To House Train And Communicate Better With Your Kitten</h2>
         <p>SEPTEMBER 26, 2023</p>
         <p><b>Does your kitten rummage through the trash or regularly steal food off the kitchen counter when you are not looking?</b>
            Do you come home to scratches on your couch or catch them in the middle of taking a bathroom break on your favourite rug? As pet parents, it is natural for you to get upset about this. But before you get angry, take a deep breath, step back and ask yourself: Does my kitten even understand that what he/she is doing is not appropriate? And what can I do to make the situation easier for both of us?
          <br>

          <br>Add a cat tree to your kitten’s space. Kittens enjoy climbing up and jumping from perch to perch, it also gives them a safe spot to exercise their claws. Clear out a  cat-safe window sill so they have a spot to watch birds and squirrels. Cats love climbing and watching the world go by, and these will help them explore without destroying your belongings.
          <br>
          <br>There are DIY methods to prevent your cat from scratching up the furniture. For example, place a layer of aluminum foil on the area you want to protect. Cats tend to leave these alone and will instead turn to scratching boards or posts that you have put out for them. 
          <br>
          <br>Introducing your new kitten to your home, one room at a time, helps establish boundaries and lets your little one explore safely. Give them access to the rooms you want them to be in. They will eventually learn which areas are off-limits (eg. The kitchen).
          <br>
          <br>Make your home cat-friendly. For instance, put a net to your balcony so that they do not jump out or get stuck on a ledge. Place their cat scratching posts where they want them instead of where you want them and so on.
          <br>
          <br>Any relationship needs time to grow, whether it is with humans or our four-legged friends. But how does one do that? This is where kitten behavioural training comes in. You might think that tricks and basic training are typically connected to dogs, but cats can learn them too! That's right—kitten behavioural training is possible and essential to help your kitten understand the rules of the house. Browse through our handy guide on how to house train a kitten so you are able to communicate better with your pet. 
          <br>
          <br><p><b>Before Socialisation</b></p>
          It is important to teach your kitten social skills. The reason being that well-socialised cats are more comfortable with touch, and are also more confident around you. Kitties around 5-12 weeks are more accepting of change and new experiences, so it is crucial to socialise them at this time. As they grow older, kittens begin to become more apprehensive of new things, animals and people.

            <b>Behavioural training commands that your kitten can understand easily</b><br>
            <br>The spot you choose to place the litter box in needs to have access to clean water, food, toys and a bed or mat. This is until they learn about the litter box. When everything they need is in one place, they will make use of the litter box. Once he/she is used to relieving themselves in the litter box, you can shift the food bowl, water bowl, toys and bed to the desired place. Another way to introduce your kitten to the litter box is by placing your kitten in it soon after their meal or when you sense that they need to relieve themselves.
            <br>
            <br>To conclude: Begin socialisation as early as possible. Be kind and patient with your kitten and give him/her a lot of time to learn and adjust. When kittens learn social skills, they also learn to respect boundaries and end up forming a healthier and stronger bond with you and your family.
